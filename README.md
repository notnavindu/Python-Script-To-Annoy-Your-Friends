# A Python script to send the bee movie script word by word (As seen on meme pages)

First of all, I did NOT come up with the idea, someone else did, but meme pages are sharing their video without crediting. (If you're the owner drop a message with proof, I'll give you credits. whoever came up with this is a legend.)

## How to run this shit

The code is simple, it uses `pyautogui` to automatically simulate keypresses and press enter after each word.
pyautoguidocs - https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest

`bee-short.txt` - shorter version of the script
`bee.txt` - Full script

on line 13 of `main.py` change 'bee-short.txt' to 'bee.txt. to switch to the full script

1. Clone this repo
   2.) Open Instagram, Whatsapp Web, Facebook or ANYTHING with a textbox that sends a message when you press the enter key AND the textbox doesn't lose focus when you press enter. (If it does lose focus, you might have to write some code to click on the textbox again) _(Tested on instagram web)_
2. install `pyautogui` with `pip install pyautogui`
3. Open your friends chat
4. Run `main.py`. There's a delay of 5 seconds before shit happens. CTRL+C if you don't wanna lose a friend
5. Before 5 seconds, click on your friends chat text input box thing. and wait. (see the gif)
6. I suggest doing this on side-by-side windows to easily CTRL+C the script if something goes wrong

might work. might not work. i dont really care
